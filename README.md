## Project description:
A simple and user-friendly chat was created using React and Node.js. The project allows users to send messages in real-time. Socket.IO library was used for implementing real-time functionality and React was used for building the user interface. The project also includes a user authentication system. In addition to the real-time sending feature, the project also provides a simple yet modern user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the chat.
